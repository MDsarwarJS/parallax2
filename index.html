            Bisnakandi Located on the Bangladesh-India border, this extensively visited place offers you a unique view of the natural beauty. After a road trip this trip will include a boat trip - the last part of which (about 5 km) is very rough. Once in Bisnakandi, if you are in the mood to find some peace, try to walk far away from the crown by following the upstream path. Be careful when walking on rocks. Avoid setting foot on large rocks as they may be slippery. Local hotels are good but hygiene is not guaranteed. So if possible, take your own food and water. Avoid buying branded cosmetics as most of them promise to be counterfeit and illegally imported. Overall a good place to visit in the winter season.

Enjoy the breathtaking view of high mountains, sharp rivers, picturesque waterfalls and dancing clouds.After reaching the Ratargul Swamp Forest, you will board a boat to explore one of the few freshwater wetlands in the world. Forests are naturally protected under the Forest Department (Government of Bangladesh). Evergreen forest crops are located on the banks of the river and are connected to the Chengi canal. Most of the trees that grow here are Karach trees. During the monsoon, the forest goes under 20-30 feet of water. During the rest of the year the water level is about 10 feet deep in various ways.

            Boga-lake One of the best natural places in the south of Bangladesh that is a must see. The beauty of this lake is incomparable and it is about 2300 square feet above the surface. While you cannot expect luxurious accommodation and food there, you will have a good experience of the tribal way of life and their simplicity. I can also say 'living in nature.

            A place of its own beauty. The vatiary lake resides in the northern part of he city of chittagong. The place is famous for 2 reasons; one is the placement of Bangladesh Military Academy and another is for being in a position where you can see hills, lakes and bay of bengal at the same time. Only a mile from the coastline you can enjoy the beach as well as sunset. The lake poses a beauty and the area is secured. For a ride by boat for 1hour, it will only take about 400BDT/$5. There is a place along the road that will lead you to Sunset point. Its a beautiful place; where at one side you would have the setting sun in the beach, and on the other side a beautiful mountain range. A golf club is also situated at the location owned by Bangladesh Army. Don't forget to check your travel listing when visiting chittagong; vatiary is not a place that you would miss out.
